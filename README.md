# 2. Fork It
##Simple repo to practice Forking a Repo

To see the GitHub page for forking, go here https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo

Fork this Project.  The forked repo will now exist in your account.  Add a new file with the same naming convention I used.  Write a similar program with a limerik about yourself. Remember that I and your classmates will be able to see it!  Do a Pull Request so I can add your change to my repo.
